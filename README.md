# AWS-DeepRacer-G-E
This repository is meant to document the progress made for the AWS DeepRacer autonomous vehicle as part of the Computer Science Senior Capstone at Pepperdine University.
* The *Logs* folder contains training and evaluation logs resulting from the various models produced and tested in DeepRacer.
* The *Milestone Progress* folder contains images relating to big (or rather surprising) milestones achieved when testing a reward function such as placing 5th place using a basic reward function
* The *RewardFunctions* folder contains the various reward functions implemented or currently being worked on in order to document and gauge the changes made over time to the reward function.
* The *Track Images* folder contains image references to the tracks we have trained on so far
* The *Training Graphs* folder contains the Training Graphs obtained during each training session with a model
